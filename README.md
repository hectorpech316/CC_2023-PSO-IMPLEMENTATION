## Introduction to PSO algorithm.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a stochastic
optimization technique based on swarm, which was proposed
by Eberhart and Kennedy (1995) and Kennedy and Eberhart
(1995). PSO algorithm simulates animalâ€™s social behavior,
including insects, herds, birds and fishes. These swarms conform a cooperative way to find food, and each member in the
swarms keeps changing the search pattern according to the
learning experiences of its own and other members.
Main design idea of the PSO algorithm is closely related
to two researches: One is evolutionary algorithm, just like
evolutionary algorithm; PSO also uses a swarm mode which
makes it to simultaneously search large region in the solution space of the optimized objective function. The other is
artificial life, namely it studies the artificial systems with life
characteristics.
